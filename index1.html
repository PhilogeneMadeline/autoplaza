                   <p class="st">The Boulos Group’s ambitions for progress came to be from the purchases and innovation within the<br> businesses of the country. While being faithful to the initial initiative, the Boulos Group has imposed<br>itself with its originality and expertise without letting time ruin anything in all they do because it can be<br>very difficult to resist the dynamic and instable caprice of time. Difficulties have always existed and will<br>continue to exist in the long run that the Group has gone through or will have to go through. However,<br>the experience has been able to reiterate its determination.</p>

                   <p class="st">The definition given is not just a matter of business in the sense of a commercial transaction, it is rather<br>broadened because it extends into two worlds : The world of investment and the Social. Above all, the<br>Boulos Investment Group is defined as a Haitian company. As a result, they are also moved by the desire<br> to change Haiti just like every patriotic Haitian who loves this country. For this, in addition to the<br>financial investments in the country, credit is also given to this company for social actions which are<br> considered for what they are, that’s to say they are essential in the development.</p>

                   <p class="st">From this two-faceted societal approach, the Boulos Group has addressed the issue of Education &<br> Health by offering the opportunity to around 25000 children, all from poor background and areas ,to<br> receive free school instruction. In partnership with other foreign institutions, the Boulos Group finances<br>and invests in the area of Health and especially in Education through its Sponsorship Program for the<br>poorest children.</p>

                   <p class="st">In 1997 for the happiness of consumers, the Boulos Group introduced Delimart, a SuperMarket line.<br> With its four points of sale, this innovation brings the best quality into this sector which is until now<br>limited and not well organized.</p>

                   <p class="st">In 2000, while a possible crisis of instability was emerging in the Haitian political horizon, the Boulos <br>Group still continued to contribute to the country’s economic progress by offering everyone the<br> possibility of obtaining a good quality means of transport that is adapted to their needs. This initiative is<br> manifested by the purchase of Auto Economic S.A. which will become Auto Plaza S.A. later on.</p>

                   <p class="st">After the devastating earthquake of January 12, 2010, the Boulos Group helped finance the<br> reconstruction of the Centers for Development & Health(CDS, French acronym which stands for <br>Centres pour Développement et la Santé)through the Boulos Foundation and the Carlos Slim Foundation.<br> These Centers have been founded by a group of professionals led by Dr. Carlos Boulos. Today this<br> patrimony has more than 2000 children who are its beneficiaries and who come from Cité Soleil.</p>
