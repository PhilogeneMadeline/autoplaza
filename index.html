                                     <h4>Company History</h4>
                                     <p>In 1974, Auto Economic S.A. was founded to sell Daihatsu vehicles in Haiti.<br> The company rapidly established itself as a new model for car dealerships <br>in the country – one that provides quality service and vehicles adapted to<br> Haitian road conditions.</p>
                                     <p>Almost three decades later, in 2000, a team of investors headed by the<br> Boulos family acquired 80% of the company. It was later reorganized<br> under the name of Auto Plaza S.A.</p>
                                     <p>The new owners further developed the Daihatsu brand. By introducing new and innovative approaches to marketing, Auto Plaza was able to grow to <br>rank among the top automobile dealerships in Haiti. In fact, by 2003, the Daihatsu Terios was the bestselling SUV in the country.</p>
                                      <p>Over the years, Auto Plaza worked to acquire new representations and expanded into different markets, including construction equipment, motorcycles<br> and generators. It has grown an average of 16% YOY.<br></p>
                                      <h4>Company Overview</h4>
                                      <p>The company today is a full-service dealership with close to 100 employees and two locations.<br></p>
                                      <p>It has the exclusive representation of the following brands: Audi from Germany; HINO and Yamaha from Japan; JCB heavy equipment from England; <br> JAC, Great Wall and King Long from China; Bajaj motorcycles from India.<br></p>
                                      <p>Auto Plaza continues to boost the transportation sector in Haiti by providing quality vehicles and motorcycles at affordable prices and extensive after <br>sales support (including repair and maintenance and sales of parts for all makes and models)..<br></p>
                                      <p>Auto Plaza is owned by several shareholders who are distinguished Haitian businessmen and women involved in a wide range of activities such as<br> finance, retail, manufacturing and real estate.<br></p>
                                      <h4>Parts Department</h4>

Each year, parts that have not been ordered or sold over a period of 36 months are<br> removed from the inventory in a bid to reduce dead stock.<br></p>
                                      <p>A group of professionals with over ten years of experience working in the field manages and operates the department. Sales counter specialists are<br> trained by brand to provide quick and efficient service.<br></p>
